        content:<div>We will learn how to use the method channel in Flutter to communicate data between Flutter and native code. In this article, Understanding how to pass arguments to the Android and iOS native platforms and return the value from native code to Flutter. Since the dawn of time‚Ä¶ okay, since the beginning of CSS at least, we have been taught that CSS is cascading. It's literally in the name, they are Cascading Style Sheets. Via CSS, an element can target an element inside of it, then an element inside, etc. But never, ever in the reverse order. An element can not apply styles to a parent element by any means other than via JavaScript.
        Until now.
        The CSS :has selector is now supported by all major browsers, and with it, we actually can now target parent elements. And more! The world, indeed, is turned upside down. If you, like me, started your dev career in those blessed times when we were doing round corners on elements via transparent GIFs, the possibilities today will blow your mind.
        So, other than being a cool new toy, what practical use does it actually have in the React world? Let's take a look at three very exciting ones.
        <p>This changes the background of a .card element inside a .content element to light grey and adds margins to images inside. So that it's visually separated from the text.

        We can also select the next sibling with + or ~ combinators. For example, if this image is right after the .card element, we might want to add an additional margin to it so that it's even more visually separated.        </p>
